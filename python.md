sets -
- remove() will give error if element is not there but discard() will not give error
- o and false are same so if in set both are there then it will only give the element in left like (0,false) then will give only 0

list ans set diff
- list have index but set dosnb't
- list = []  and set ={}
- list is ordered and set is unordered as no index
- listr can have duplicates but sets can't have duplicate
- set have elemenst in it in sorted manner always - number then boolean then string and number will be sorted and boolean and string also in alphabetical order
- list will pop from last element if not given index , but in set pop will remove any random element
- list can be chnaged but set can't as set don't have index


touple
- its mostly same as list
- can have duplicate like lists
- if you want only single elment in touple then use a comma while defining it otherwise it will take it assuming it as a string like - tuple1 = ('abc',)
- have indexing same to lists
- we can't add remove element in touple directly as it dosn't have any speciffic functions for that , to add/remove then you have to convert in into list first

dict
- if same name for key is there then it will take the latest pair value in that
- dict1['name'] => to access any key value

diff between nested if and elif
- nested if , the nested one will be reached only if the above if is true of satisfied , but in elif, it will reach elif only when above if false.
