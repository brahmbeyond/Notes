Here's a detailed explanation of HTML lists, tables, images, forms, and frames:

**HTML Lists**

HTML lists are used to group a collection of items together, such as a list of options, a list of links, or a list of items to be displayed. There are three types of lists in HTML:

1. **Ordered List (OL)**: An ordered list is a list of items that are numbered in a specific order. The numbers can be in numerical, alphabetical, or roman numeral format.

Example:
```
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```
Output:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

2. **Unordered List (UL)**: An unordered list is a list of items that are not numbered. Instead, they are displayed with bullet points.

Example:
```
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
Output:

• Item 1
• Item 2
• Item 3

3. **Definition List (DL)**: A definition list is a list of terms and their definitions.

Example:
```
<dl>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>Definition of Term 1</dd>
  <dt>Term 2</dt>
  <dd>Definition of Term 2</dd>
</dl>
```
Output:

Term 1
Definition of Term 1

Term 2
Definition of Term 2

**HTML Tables**

HTML tables are used to display data in a tabular format. A table consists of rows and columns, and each intersection of a row and column is called a cell.

Example:
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
Output:

| Name | Age |
| --- | --- |
| John | 25 |
| Jane | 30 |

**HTML Images**

HTML images are used to add images to a web page. The `img` tag is used to specify the source of the image, and the `alt` attribute is used to specify alternative text for the image.

Example:
```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image of a cat">
```
Output: An image of a cat will be displayed.

**HTML Forms**

HTML forms are used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing. A form typically consists of form controls such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons.

Example:
```
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

```.
<form action="https://example.com/process" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="username" id="username">

<label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>
<select id="cars" name="cars">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="fiat">Fiat</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

Output: A form with two text fields and a submit button will be displayed.

**HTML Frames**

HTML frames are used to divide a web page into multiple sections, each of which can display a separate HTML document. Frames are no longer supported in HTML5 and are considered deprecated.

Example:
```
<frameset cols="25%, 75%">
  <frame src="frame1.html">
  <frame src="frame2.html">
</frameset>
```
Output: A web page with two frames, each displaying a separate HTML document, will be displayed.

Note: Frames are no longer supported in HTML5 and are considered deprecated. Instead, use CSS layouts or responsive design to create multi-column layouts.

Here are some additional attributes and elements that can be used with the above elements:

* **List attributes**:
	+ `type`: specifies the type of bullet point or numbering system to use
	+ `start`: specifies the starting number for an ordered list
	+ `value`: specifies the value of a list item
* **Table attributes**:
	+ `border`: specifies the width of the table border
	+ `cellpadding`: specifies the space between the cell content and the cell border
	+ `cellspacing`: specifies the space between cells
	+ `width` and `height`: specify the width and height of the table
* **Image attributes**:
	+ `width` and `height`: specify the width and height of the image
	+ `border`: specifies the width of the image border
	+ `align`: specifies the alignment of the image
* **Form attributes**:
	+ `action`: specifies the URL of the server-side script that will process the form data
	+ `method`: specifies the HTTP method to use when submitting the form data
	+ `enctype`: specifies the encoding type of the form data
* **Frame attributes**:
	+ `src`: specifies the URL of the HTML document to display in the frame
	+ `name`: specifies the name of the frame
	+ `scrolling`: specifies whether the frame should have a scrollbar

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Here's a comprehensive overview of CSS, including common examples and concepts to help with your revision:

**What is CSS?**

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages written in HTML or XML. It's used to separate presentation from content, making it easier to maintain and update websites.

**Basic CSS Syntax**

CSS consists of rules, known as styles, that are applied to HTML elements. A style consists of three parts:

1. **Selector**: specifies the HTML element(s) to apply the style to
2. **Property**: specifies the aspect of the element to style (e.g. color, font-size, background-image)
3. **Value**: specifies the value of the property (e.g. red, 16px, url('image.jpg'))

Example:
```
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 36px;
}
```
This style applies to all `<h1>` elements, setting their text color to red and font size to 36px.

**CSS Selectors**

Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements. Here are some common selectors:

1. **Element selector**: targets a specific HTML element (e.g. `h1`, `p`, `img`)
2. **Class selector**: targets elements with a specific class (e.g. `.header`, `.footer`)
3. **ID selector**: targets an element with a specific ID (e.g. `#header`, `#footer`)
4. **Combinators**: used to combine selectors (e.g. `h1.header`, `p > a`)
5. **Pseudo-classes**: used to target elements based on their state (e.g. `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`)
6. **Pseudo-elements**: used to target specific parts of an element (e.g. `::before`, `::after`)

**CSS Properties**

Here are some common CSS properties:

1. **Color and Background**
	* `color`: sets the text color
	* `background-color`: sets the background color
	* `background-image`: sets the background image
2. **Typography**
	* `font-size`: sets the font size
	* `font-family`: sets the font family
	* `font-weight`: sets the font weight (e.g. bold, italic)
3. **Layout and Positioning**
	* `width` and `height`: set the element's dimensions
	* `margin` and `padding`: set the element's spacing
	* `display`: sets the element's display type (e.g. block, inline, inline-block)
	* `position`: sets the element's position (e.g. relative, absolute, fixed)
4. **Box Model**
	* `border`: sets the element's border
	* `border-radius`: sets the element's border radius
	* `box-shadow`: sets the element's box shadow
5. **Text and Images**
	* `text-align`: sets the text alignment
	* `text-decoration`: sets the text decoration (e.g. underline, overline)
	* `image`: sets the image properties (e.g. width, height, border)

**Common CSS Examples**

1. **Styling a Header**
```
header {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
```
2. **Styling a Button**
```
button {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
3. **Creating a Grid Layout**
```
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
4. **Styling a Navigation Menu**
```
nav ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

nav li {
  margin-right: 20px;
}

nav a {
  color: #333;
  text-decoration: none;
}

nav a:hover {
  color: #666;
}
```
5. **Creating a Responsive Design**
```
/* Desktop styles */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* styles for desktop devices */
}

/* Tablet styles */
@media (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 767px) {
  /* styles for tablet devices */
}

/* Mobile styles */
@media (max-width: 479px) {
  /* styles for mobile devices */
}
```
**CSS Units**

CSS units are used to specify the value of a property. Here are some common units:

1. **Length units**
	* `px` (pixels)
	* `em` (relative to font size)
	* `rem` (relative to root element font size)
	* `%` (percentage)
2. **Time units**
	* `s` (seconds)
	* `ms` (milliseconds)
3. **Frequency units**
	* `Hz` (hertz)

**CSS Preprocessors**

CSS preprocessors are tools that allow you to write CSS using a more programming-like syntax, which is then compiled into regular CSS. Popular preprocessors include:

1. **Sass** (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets)
2. **Less** (Leaner Style Sheets)

**CSS Frameworks**

CSS frameworks are pre-built sets of CSS styles and classes that can be used to speed up development. Popular frameworks include:

1. **Bootstrap**
2. **Tailwind CSS**
3. **Foundation**

I hope this helps with your CSS revision! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of these topics.

I'd be happy to explain XML, DTD, XML Schemas, and how to present and use XML in detail.

**What is XML?**

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language that is used to store and transport data between systems. It is a standard format for representing data in a way that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

XML is similar to HTML, but whereas HTML is used to display data, XML is used to describe data. XML documents contain elements, which are represented by tags (also called elements or nodes). These tags are used to define the structure and content of the data.

Here is an example of a simple XML document:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bookstore>
  <book category="COOKING">
    <title lang="en">Everyday Italian</title>
    <author>Giada De Laurentiis</author>
    <year>2005</year>
    <price>30.00</price>
  </book>
  <book category="CHILDREN">
    <title lang="en">Harry Potter</title>
    <author>J.K. Rowling</author>
    <year>2005</year>
    <price>29.99</price>
  </book>
</bookstore>
```
In this example, the XML document contains a `bookstore` element, which contains two `book` elements. Each `book` element has several child elements, including `title`, `author`, `year`, and `price`.

**What is a DTD?**

A DTD (Document Type Definition) is a set of rules that defines the structure and organization of an XML document. It specifies the elements, attributes, and relationships between them that are allowed in an XML document.

A DTD is used to validate an XML document, ensuring that it conforms to the rules defined in the DTD. This helps to ensure that the XML document is well-formed and that the data is consistent and accurate.

Here is an example of a DTD for the XML document above:
```
<!ELEMENT bookstore (book+)>
<!ELEMENT book (title, author, year, price)>
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT year (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT price (#PCDATA)>

<!ATTLIST book category CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ATTLIST title lang CDATA #IMPLIED>
```
In this example, the DTD defines the elements and attributes that are allowed in the XML document. It specifies that the `bookstore` element can contain one or more `book` elements, and that each `book` element must contain a `title`, `author`, `year`, and `price` element. It also specifies the attributes that are allowed for each element.

**What is an XML Schema?**

An XML Schema is a way to define the structure and organization of an XML document using an XML-based language. It is similar to a DTD, but is more powerful and flexible.

An XML Schema is used to validate an XML document, ensuring that it conforms to the rules defined in the schema. This helps to ensure that the XML document is well-formed and that the data is consistent and accurate.

Here is an example of an XML Schema for the XML document above:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
            targetNamespace="http://example.com/bookstore"
            xmlns="http://example.com/bookstore"
            elementFormDefault="qualified">

  <xs:element name="bookstore">
    <xs:complexType>
      <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element name="book" maxOccurs="unbounded">
          <xs:complexType>
            <xs:sequence>
              <xs:element name="title" type="xs:string"/>
              <xs:element name="author" type="xs:string"/>
              <xs:element name="year" type="xs:integer"/>
              <xs:element name="price" type="xs:decimal"/>
            </xs:sequence>
            <xs:attribute name="category" type="xs:string"/>
          </xs:complexType>
        </xs:element>
      </xs:sequence>
    </xs:complexType>
  </xs:element>

</xs:schema>
```
In this example, the XML Schema defines the elements and attributes that are allowed in the XML document. It specifies that the `bookstore` element can contain one or more `book` elements, and that each `book` element must contain a `title`, `author`, `year`, and `price` element. It also specifies the attributes that are allowed for each element.

**Presenting and Using XML**

XML can be presented and used in a variety of ways, including:

1. **XML Documents**: XML documents can be used to store and transport data between systems.
2. **XML Schemas**: XML Schemas can be used to define the structure and organization of an XML document.
3. **DTDs**: DTDs can be used to validate an XML document, ensuring that it conforms to the rules defined in the DTD.
4. **XSLT**: XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) can be used to transform and format XML data for presentation.
5. **XML Parsers**: XML parsers can be used to read and parse XML documents, allowing the data to be accessed and manipulated programmatically.

Here is an example of how to use XML in a web application:
```
// XML document
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bookstore>
  <book category="COOKING">
    <title lang="en">Everyday Italian</title>
    <author>Giada De Laurentiis</author>
    <year>2005</year>
    <price>30.00</price>
  </book>
  <book category="CHILDREN">
    <title lang="en">Harry Potter</title>
    <author>J.K. Rowling</author>
    <year>2005</year>
    <price>29.99</price>
  </book>
</bookstore>

// XSLT stylesheet
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
  exclude-result-prefixes="xs">

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Bookstore</h1>
        <ul>
          <xsl:for-each select="bookstore/book">
            <li>
              <xsl:value-of select="title"/> by <xsl:value-of select="author"/>
              (<xsl:value-of select="year"/>) - $<xsl:value-of select="price"/>
            </li>
          </xsl:for-each>
        </ul>
      </body>
    </html>
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>

// HTML output
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Bookstore</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Everyday Italian by Giada De Laurentiis (2005) - $30.00</li>
      <li>Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling (2005) - $29.99</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```
In this example, the XML document is transformed using an XSLT stylesheet, which generates an HTML output that can be displayed in a web browser.

The Difference Between XML and HTML
XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

----
XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags
The XML language has no predefined tags.

The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.

HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.

With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.

----

XML Simplifies Things
XML simplifies data sharing
XML simplifies data transport
XML simplifies platform changes
XML simplifies data availability
Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible systems (or upgraded systems) is a time-consuming task for web developers. Large amounts of data must be converted, and incompatible data is often lost.

XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.

XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.

With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.

# telusko

xml - 
- to design andriod
- transfer data
- configure frameworkl

- xml is used to transfer data unlike html which sends layout also with data.

we can define tags in xml on our own 
- there should be a root tag
```
<loli>
	<name>shubham</name>
	<gender>male</gender>
</loli>
```
so here we have two things - structure and content
- structure = DTD is used to define it
- content = schema is used to define it and scheme can also define the stucture 

![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/35e2a68b-b0e2-4ed4-a24a-3920d322fda4)

![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/5641df05-2ea5-429e-b00b-35af7c36a115)


### now for DTD  - document type definition
- define file name in the xml document so it can use it
- in thid we have define the stucture( the tags and attributes used insdie the XML file)
- like in below image the tags/elements are defined using <!ELEMENT> and attributes as <!ATTLIST>
- we need to define every element in a order
- +  is used when an element is used multiple times like alien here
- #PCDATA define the data type of the child element

![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/c549e138-18dc-4a8a-a390-7b1142775b0e)


### now schema - 
- to define the content of the xml file

- first define the
```
<complexType name="aliensType>
<sequence></sequence>
</complexType>
```
and this will be for every element in xml
- now drfine the child element in that using <element>

![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/7fa35b4c-3a0a-45eb-8480-2992872f7e5f)
