## Propositional Calculus
This defines as the statements which are either true or false. They should be anyone, These are like saying the **sky is blue**, true or false, that's it and nothing else. Like **5 is less than 10** which is true, here its confirmed.



## First order predicate calculus
This also tells true or false, but it depends upon the variable values. Like **'x' is greater than 10.** so now it depends upon the value of 'x' that if this is true or not. 


#### - Quantifiers 
These are to define the scope , to express the statement if for all or for some.
- Universal Quantifiers (∀): for all or for every
- Existential Quantifiers (∃): for some

#### - Connectives
Predicate calculus also uses logical connectives like AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), and IMPLIES (→) to combine predicates and form more complex statements.


#### - example:
Like we represent Sonu with 'S' then -
LovesMath(S) = means (S) Sonu love math.
***Sentence*** -  ∀S LovesMath(S)      ( for all S , love math)
means all Sonu loves math

 - It  solves  Propositional Calculus shortcomings as it depends on variables to tell if they are true or not.
