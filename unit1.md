Let's start with the basics.

**Overview of Computer Networks**

A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that communicate with each other to share resources, exchange data, and provide services. These devices can be computers, laptops, mobile phones, servers, printers, routers, switches, and other hardware and software components.

**Key Components of a Computer Network:**

1. **Devices** (Nodes): These are the computers, laptops, mobile phones, servers, and other hardware components that make up the network.
2. **Links** (Connections): These are the physical or wireless connections between devices, such as cables, Wi-Fi, or fiber optic cables.
3. **Protocols**: These are the set of rules and standards that govern data communication over the network, ensuring that devices can understand each other.

**Types of Computer Networks:**

1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A LAN connects devices in a limited geographical area, such as a home, office building, or campus.
2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A WAN connects devices over a larger geographical area, such as a city or country.
3. ** Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A MAN connects devices in a metropolitan area, such as a city or town.
4. **Wireless Network (WLAN)**: A WLAN connects devices wirelessly, using radio waves or infrared signals.
5. **Internet**: The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate using standardized protocols.

**Network Topology:**

Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network. Common topologies include:

1. **Bus Topology**: A single cable connects all devices in a linear sequence.
2. **Star Topology**: Devices connect to a central hub or switch.
3. **Ring Topology**: Devices connect in a circular configuration.
4. **Mesh Topology**: Each device connects to every other device.

**Network Architecture:**

Network architecture refers to the design and organization of a network, including the relationships between devices, protocols, and services. Common architectures include:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: Clients request services from a central server.
2. **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Devices act as both clients and servers.

**Network Protocols:**

Network protocols are the set of rules and standards that govern data communication over the network. Common protocols include:

1. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: The most widely used protocol suite for the internet.
2. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring data over the web.
3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring files over the network.

**Example:**

Imagine a university campus with multiple buildings, each with its own LAN. The LANs are connected using a WAN, which allows students and faculty to access resources and communicate with each other across the campus. The university's network architecture is based on a client-server model, with servers providing email, file sharing, and internet access to clients (laptops, desktops, and mobile devices). The network uses TCP/IP as its protocol suite, and devices communicate with each other using HTTP and FTP protocols.

I hope this overview helps you understand the basics of computer networks! Do you have any specific questions or would you like me to explain any of these topics in more detail?

The OSI model!

**OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)**

The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand how data is transmitted over a network. It's a 7-layered model that helps network engineers and developers design, implement, and troubleshoot computer networks.
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection, where open stands to say non proprietary. It is a 7-layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe. The OSI reference model was developed by ISO – ‘International Organization for Standardization‘, in the year 1984.

The OSI model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding network communication. However it is usually not directly implemented in its entirety in real-world networking hardware or software. Instead, specific protocols and technologies are often designed based on the principles outlined in the OSI model to facilitate efficient data transmission and networking operations.

**The 7 Layers of the OSI Model:**

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**

**Let's break down each layer:**

**1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)**

* Defines the physical means of data transmission, such as cables, Wi-Fi, or fiber optics.
* Specifies the voltage levels, cable specifications, and network topology.
* Examples: RJ-45 connectors, Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi routers.
* ![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/9405505b-c94c-48b3-9bdd-38662447a454)


**2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**

* Provides error-free transfer of data frames between two devices on the same network.
* Manages access to the network, resolves collisions, and corrects errors.
* Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).

**3. Network Layer (Layer 3)**

* Routes data between networks, providing logical addressing and routing.
* Determines the best path for data to travel between networks.
* Examples: IP addresses, routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP).
*
* ![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/bd4364e8-7551-4626-8673-f58ddbbc6343)


**4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)**

* Provides reliable data transfer between devices, including error detection and correction.
* Manages data segmentation, sequencing, and reassembly.
* Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
* ![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/ff28d876-1de2-4476-9467-ae3d6446674b)
* ![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/3f55ee01-1909-4f94-84e0-6f158c90e3b2)
* ![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/6bf0aa6c-e472-491d-bb3e-5f661c354df7)

* 





**5. Session Layer (Layer 5)**

* Establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications.
* Controls the dialogue between applications, including synchronization and checkpointing.
* Examples: NetBIOS, SSH (Secure Shell).
*![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/00e1ea1d-98f4-491f-ab05-20d978d18563)

**6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**

* Converts data into a format that can be understood by the receiving device.
* Performs data compression, encryption, and formatting.
* Examples: SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), ASCII, JPEG.
* ![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/8eea639a-4a9e-4f91-8095-c2d94388854a)


**7. Application Layer (Layer 7)**

* Provides services and interfaces for applications to communicate with each other.
* Supports functions such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.
* Examples: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
* ![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/a08b31be-d4ad-4924-a52a-1c02a3153502)


**How the OSI Model Works:**

When a device sends data, it travels down the OSI layers, with each layer adding its own headers and information. The receiving device then travels up the OSI layers, removing headers and information as it goes.

**Example:**

Imagine a user sending an email using a web-based email client. Here's how the OSI model comes into play:

* Application Layer (Layer 7): The email client uses HTTP to send the email to the mail server.
* Presentation Layer (Layer 6): The email is formatted and encrypted using SSL/TLS.
* Session Layer (Layer 5): The email client establishes a connection with the mail server.
* Transport Layer (Layer 4): The email is segmented and sent using TCP.
* Network Layer (Layer 3): The email is routed to the mail server using IP addresses.
* Data Link Layer (Layer 2): The email is transmitted over the network using Ethernet.
* Physical Layer (Layer 1): The email is sent over the physical network infrastructure (cables, Wi-Fi, etc.).

I hope this helps you understand the OSI model! Do you have any specific questions or would you like me to explain any of these layers in more detail?



-------

Let's dive deeper into TCP/IP and explore its components, how they work, and some examples to help illustrate the concepts.

**TCP/IP: A Suite of Protocols**

TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols that enables devices to communicate with each other over the internet. It's a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted, routed, and received over the internet.

**The Four Layers of TCP/IP**

TCP/IP is divided into four layers, each responsible for a specific function:

1. **Network Access Layer** (Equivalent to OSI Layers 1-2)
	* Responsible for getting data to the network and accessing network resources.
	* Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
2. **Internet Layer** (Equivalent to OSI Layer 3)
	* Responsible for routing data between networks.
	* Protocols: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)
3. **Transport Layer** (Equivalent to OSI Layer 4)
	* Responsible for providing reliable data transfer between devices.
	* Protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
4. **Application Layer** (Equivalent to OSI Layers 5-7)
	* Responsible for providing services and interfaces for applications to communicate with each other.
	* Protocols: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

**IP (Internet Protocol)**

IP is responsible for addressing and routing data packets between networks. Here's how it works:

* **IP Addresses**: Each device on a network is assigned a unique IP address, which is used to identify the device and route data packets to it.
* **Packet Forwarding**: When a device sends data to another device, the data is broken into small packets, and each packet is given a header with the source and destination IP addresses. Routers along the path examine the packet headers and forward the packets to the next hop on the path to the destination device.

**Example:**

Imagine you want to access a website, let's say [www.example.com](http://www.example.com). Here's what happens:

* Your device sends a request to the website's server using IP.
* The request is broken into packets, and each packet is given a header with your device's IP address (source) and the website's server IP address (destination).
* The packets are routed through multiple routers to reach the website's server.
* The server responds with the requested webpage, breaking it into packets and sending them back to your device.
* Your device reassembles the packets and displays the webpage.

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

TCP is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between devices. Here's how it works:

* **Connection Establishment**: Before sending data, TCP establishes a connection with the destination device using a three-way handshake:
	1. Your device sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the destination device to initiate the connection.
	2. The destination device responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet to acknowledge the connection request.
	3. Your device responds with an ACK packet to complete the connection establishment.
* **Data Transfer**: Once the connection is established, your device can send data to the destination device.
* **Error Detection and Correction**: TCP performs error-checking on packets to ensure data integrity. If a packet is lost or corrupted, TCP retransmits the packet to ensure reliable data transfer.

**Example:**

Imagine you want to upload a file to a server using FTP. Here's what happens:

* Your device establishes a TCP connection with the server using the three-way handshake.
* Your device breaks the file into packets and sends them to the server using TCP.
* The server acknowledges receipt of each packet and sends an ACK packet back to your device.
* If a packet is lost or corrupted, TCP retransmits the packet to ensure reliable data transfer.
* Once all packets are received, the server reassembles the file and stores it.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides best-effort data transfer between devices. Here's how it works:

* **No Connection Establishment**: UDP does not establish a connection with the destination device before sending data.
* **No Error Detection and Correction**: UDP does not perform error-checking on packets, and it does not retransmit lost or corrupted packets.
* **Fast and Efficient**: UDP is often used for applications that require fast and efficient data transfer, such as online gaming, video streaming, and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).

**Example:**

Imagine you're playing an online game, and you need to send your game state to the server. Here's what happens:

* Your device sends a UDP packet to the server with your game state.
* The server receives the packet and updates your game state.
* If the packet is lost or corrupted, the server may not receive the update, but the game continues to run without interruption.

I hope this helps you understand TCP/IP in more detail! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

MAC protocols for high-speed LANs!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0h0dC4Zycs    - gate smashers  = mac overview


Here's an explanation of the MAC protocols in a simple and easy-to-understand manner, along with detailed information for exam preparation:

**Random Access Protocols**

These protocols allow multiple devices to share a common channel and transmit data randomly.

1. **Overview of Random Access Protocols**

Random access protocols are used in networks where multiple devices share a common channel and transmit data randomly. These protocols are used in wireless networks, such as Wi-Fi and cellular networks.

2. **ALOHA Protocol**

* **How it works:** In ALOHA, a device sends a packet whenever it has data to transmit. If a collision occurs (i.e., two devices send packets at the same time), the devices wait for a random time and then retransmit the packet.
* **Advantages:** Simple to implement, low latency
* **Disadvantages:** High collision rate, low throughput

3. **CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) Protocol**

* **How it works:** In CSMA, a device senses the channel before transmitting a packet. If the channel is idle, the device transmits the packet. If the channel is busy, the device waits until the channel is idle.
* **Advantages:** Better performance than ALOHA, low latency
* **Disadvantages:** Still prone to collisions, not suitable for high-traffic networks

4. **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) Protocol**

* **How it works:** In CSMA/CD, a device senses the channel before transmitting a packet. If the channel is idle, the device transmits the packet. If a collision occurs, the device stops transmitting and waits for a random time before retransmitting.
* **Advantages:** Better performance than CSMA, high throughput
* **Disadvantages:** Complex to implement, requires collision detection mechanism

5. **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) Protocol**

* **How it works:** In CSMA/CA, a device senses the channel before transmitting a packet. If the channel is idle, the device transmits a request-to-send (RTS) packet. If the RTS packet is acknowledged, the device transmits the data packet.
* **Advantages:** Better performance than CSMA/CD, high throughput
* **Disadvantages:** Complex to implement, requires RTS and acknowledgement packets

**Control Access Protocols**

These protocols control access to the channel and ensure that only one device transmits at a time.

1. **Registration Protocol**

* **How it works:** In registration protocol, each device registers with a central controller before transmitting data. The controller assigns a unique identifier to each device and ensures that only one device transmits at a time.
* **Advantages:** Simple to implement, low latency
* **Disadvantages:** Requires a central controller, not suitable for large networks

2. **Polling Protocol**

* **How it works:** In polling protocol, a central controller polls each device in a sequence to check if it has data to transmit. If a device has data, it transmits the data.
* **Advantages:** Simple to implement, low latency
* **Disadvantages:** Requires a central controller, not suitable for large networks

3. **Tokenization Protocol**

* **How it works:** In tokenization protocol, a token is passed from device to device in a sequence. A device can transmit data only when it possesses the token.
* **Advantages:** Simple to implement, low latency
* **Disadvantages:** Requires a token-passing mechanism, not suitable for large networks

**Channelization Protocols**

These protocols divide the channel into multiple sub-channels to increase the capacity of the network.

1. **FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) Protocol**

* **How it works:** In FDMA, the channel is divided into multiple frequency bands, and each device is assigned a unique frequency band.
* **Advantages:** High capacity, low interference
* **Disadvantages:** Requires complex frequency management, not suitable for dynamic networks

2. **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) Protocol**

* **How it works:** In TDMA, the channel is divided into multiple time slots, and each device is assigned a unique time slot.
* **Advantages:** High capacity, low interference
* **Disadvantages:** Requires complex time slot management, not suitable for dynamic networks

3. **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) Protocol**

* **How it works:** In CDMA, each device is assigned a unique code, and the codes are used to distinguish between devices.
* **Advantages:** High capacity, low interference, suitable for dynamic networks
* **Disadvantages:** Requires complex code management, high computational complexity

I hope this explanation helps you understand the MAC protocols in a simple and easy-to-understand manner, along with detailed information for exam preparation!

Fast access technologies!

Fast access technologies

Fast access technologies in computer networks refer to methods and technologies that improve the speed and efficiency of accessing data and resources over a network. These technologies are crucial for enhancing network performance, reducing latency, and improving overall user experience. Here are some common fast access technologies used in computer networks:

⦁	Caching: Caching involves storing frequently accessed data closer to the user, either on the client-side or on intermediary servers (such as proxy servers or Content Delivery Networks - CDNs). This reduces the need to retrieve data from the original source every time it's requested, resulting in faster access times.

⦁	Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): CDNs are a network of distributed servers strategically placed across different geographical locations. They store cached copies of web content (such as images, videos, and web pages) closer to users, reducing latency and improving load times, especially for users accessing content from distant locations.

⦁	Load Balancing: Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, and minimize response times. By evenly distributing workload among servers, load balancers prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed, thus ensuring fast access to resources.

⦁	Data Compression: Data compression techniques reduce the size of data transmitted over the network, thereby reducing bandwidth usage and improving transfer speeds. Compression algorithms like gzip or Brotli are commonly used to compress text-based data (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript), while media codecs (e.g., MP3, JPEG) are used for compressing multimedia content.

⦁	HTTP/2 and HTTP/3: These are newer versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) designed to improve web page loading times. HTTP/2 introduces features like multiplexing, header compression, and server push, while HTTP/3 uses the QUIC protocol to further optimize performance by reducing latency and improving security.

⦁	Solid-State Drives (SSDs): SSDs offer faster data access speeds compared to traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) due to their lack of moving parts and use of flash memory. Incorporating SSDs into network storage solutions can significantly reduce data retrieval times and improve overall system responsiveness.
⦁	Anycast: Anycast is a networking technique that routes traffic to the nearest (in terms of network distance) among multiple destinations that share the same IP address. This can be used to improve the speed of accessing content or services by directing users to the nearest server or data center.

⦁	Content Preloading: Content preloading anticipates user actions and pre-fetches or preloads resources that are likely to be requested in the future. By proactively fetching data before it's actually needed, this technique can reduce perceived latency and improve responsiveness, especially for interactive web applications.

## Error control =>
- sender sends a req, and receiver receives , how will sender know if it receives. Also if lost inbetween them how wil it know. for that itimer is used
- sender sends a req and starts a timeer , receiver receives and checks and send ack to sender , if it reaches timer is off, if not reachers in time , the snder sendds again. ( the situations can be like sender sends but it not reaches, receiver snds but it not reachers)
- sends frame by frame
- sender sends and receiver sends back 2-3 ack for same, then its better to give it index or numbering to know its dupicate packets



## Error Detection and Correction
when sending the data there can be chnaces that data is correcpted in between with noise or other factors , so for that when data s=comes to receiver , it dosn't performs the required function it has to do.
types of error =
![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/fe476d5f-5196-4c0e-a210-b4a4ead02a2b)
1. single bit => one bit is correcpted
2. multiple bit error => multiple bits are correcpted
3. brust error => multiple bits which are simultanous or adjacent to each other are correcpted

So Data link lyaer performs some mechanism to detect and resolve them 
![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/26bb7aca-1ff9-4839-a330-a8e3eb717ead)

1. Parity check =>
- adds 1 at end of no. of 1s is odd and adds 0 at end of no. of 1s is even(as 1s already even so adds 0)
- then sends to the network and after that before reaching the receiver it check for error.
- if 1s are even then no transmission error. (transmission without error) (in reality same)
- if anybit is changed and 1s became odd then obvously that its error .(transmission with single bit error)
- if like bits are changed but 1s already even then also its error as in reality data changed (transmission with multiple bits error).

![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/682513d1-6d02-410c-8a5c-9e79f21895c9)

![image](https://github.com/brahmbeyond/Notes-App/assets/65112908/b503208e-6992-46a5-9985-bbc56adcf48b)

2. checksum error detection

   Imagine you're sending a secret message to your friend. To make sure the message arrives without any mistakes, you could add up all the letters in the message and tell your friend the total. Then, your friend can add up the letters on their end too. If the totals match, it means the message arrived intact.

In computer networks, data is sent in chunks called packets. Each packet has a checksum, which is like the total of all the data in the packet. When the packet reaches its destination, the receiving computer also calculates the checksum. If the calculated checksum matches the one sent with the packet, it means the data arrived safely. But if they don't match, it indicates that there might have been an error during transmission, like a flipped bit or some noise.

So, checksum error detection is like double-checking the total of your message to make sure it hasn't changed during delivery. If the totals match, everything's good. If not, there might be a mistake somewhere.

3. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

   Imagine you're sending a package through the mail. Before sealing the package, you decide to add a special seal with a unique pattern on it. This pattern is created by doing some math based on the contents of the package. You then send the package off to your friend.

When your friend receives the package, they look at the seal and know how to do the same math to generate the pattern themselves. If the pattern they create matches the one on the seal, they can be pretty confident that the package hasn't been tampered with during transit.

In the world of computer networks, data is like the contents of the package, and the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is like the special seal. It's a mathematical calculation based on the data that's added to the end of the transmission. When the data arrives at its destination, the receiver does the same math to check if the CRC generated matches the one sent with the data. If they match, it's likely that the data arrived intact. If not, it suggests there may have been errors during transmission.

So, CRC is like a digital seal that helps ensure the integrity of the data as it travels across the network.
 4. What's Hamming Code?:
Hamming codes help computers spot and fix errors that happen when sending data. They do this by adding some extra bits to the original data.
Key Terms:
Data Bits: These are the original bits of data you want to send.
Parity Bits: Extra bits added to the data to help detect and fix errors.
Hamming Distance: It's like a measure of how different two sets of bits are.
Syndrome: A pattern of bits that shows if an error occurred and where it happened.
Example:
Let's say you want to send the message "1101".
Adding Parity Bits:
To decide how many parity bits to add, you need to find the smallest number that gives you enough bits to cover both data and parity bits. For 4 data bits, you'd need 3 parity bits.
These parity bits are placed at specific positions (like 1, 2, 4, 8...).
Each parity bit checks certain data bits and gets set to make the total number of 1s even or odd. For example, if a parity bit checks three data bits and sees an odd number of 1s, it gets set to 1 to make the total even.
Sending the Message:
You send the message with the extra parity bits to the receiver.
Checking for Errors:
At the receiver's end, it recalculates the parity bits.
If any of the calculated parity bits don't match the received ones, it means there might be an error.
Fixing Errors:
The receiver uses the positions of the wrong parity bits (in binary) to find which bit is wrong and flips it.
